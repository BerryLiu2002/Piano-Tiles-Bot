# Piano-Tiles-Bot

Piano Tiles bot created using OpenCV to detect tiles
Works specifically for https://www.gamesgames.com/game/magic-piano-tiles

<h2>Bug to be fixed:</h2> 
Cursor will successfully move and click the start button. <br>
However, during execution of clicking tiles, the cursor will <br>
move as expected but not click.<br>
Attempted solutions include using pydirectinput to click, which<br>
did not change the issue.
